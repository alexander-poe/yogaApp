## Yoga App 

Using a timer made with react, the user is able to experience a variety of simple yoga poses played to some soothing music.
If you are into that kind of thing, then you are going to enjoy the sounds of binaural tunes while your inner yogi sprouts off the screen and kicks you into shape.
